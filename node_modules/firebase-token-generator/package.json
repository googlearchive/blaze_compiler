Available options \nare:\n\n* **expires** (Number) - A timestamp (as number of seconds since epoch)\ndenoting the time after which this token should no longer be valid.\n\n* **notBefore** (Number) - A timestamp (as number of seconds since epoch)\ndenoting the time before which this token should be rejected by the server.\n\n* **admin** (boolean) - Set to true if you want to disable all\n[security rules](https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/rule-expressions/index.html) for this client.\n\n* **debug** (boolean) - Set to true to enable debug output from your Security \nRules.  This debug output will be automatically output to the JavaScript \nconsole for any client that's authenticated with a token with the debug flag \nset to true.  You should generally <i>not</i> leave this set to true in \nproduction (as it slows down the rules implementation and gives your users \nvisibility into your rules), but it can be helpful for debugging.\n\nYou can generate a token with options by passing a second argument to \n`createToken()`, as shown:\n\n```js\n    var token = tokenGenerator.createToken(\n      {some: \"arbitrary\", data: \"here\"},\n      {admin: true}\n    );\n```\n\nTesting\n-------\nThe test suite is in test/test.js. Run it by:\n\n```bash\n    $ npm install -g mocha\n    $ mocha\n    5 tests complete\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n[MIT](http://firebase.mit-license.org)\n",
